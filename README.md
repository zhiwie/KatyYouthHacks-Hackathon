## Inspiration
_We wanted to create something that will match the current trend so we went to browse the official Paris Olympics 2024 merchandise and thought it would be cool if we designed a website that not only sells Olympic stuff but also gets people pumped about the games! And that’s the moment where the idea of OlympiaGear was born._

## What it does
OlympiaGear acts as a one-stop-shop for Olympic fans:
1. **Event Showcase**: 
_We've got all the exciting Olympic moments - ceremony replays, upcoming event schedules, and a shiny medal count._
2. **User Experience**: 
_A seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for users_
3. **Olympic Central**: 
_It acts as an informative hub for Olympic where users can stay updated on Olympic events and their favorite athletes._

## How we built it
We built OlympiaGear using:
1. **HTML**: 
_To structure the content of our web pages._
2. **CSS**: 
_To style our web pages and create a visually appealing design._
3. **JavaScript**: 
_To add interactivity and dynamic features to OlympiaGear._

### Key Features:
- **Responsive Design**: 
_Our website looks great on all devices._
- **Color-Changing Effect**: 
_We used JavaScript to allow users to hover over stuff and watch the color changes._
- **Sticky Navbar**: 
_Our navigation bar follows users as they scroll, so you’re never lost in OlympiaGear._
- **Eye-Catching Media**: 
_We’ve used some GIFs and videos to keep things interesting and appealing._
- **Zoom-In Effect**:
_We've used JavaScript to allow product image to zoom in when pointing._
- **Semantic Elements**:
_We also used semantic elements in our html code to express the contents clearly. Instead of using non-semantic elements 'div' and 'span', we use  'form', 'table', 'footer', etc._

## Challenges we ran into
1. **Scheduling Meetings**: 
_Coordinating common times for team meetings was challenging due to differing schedules._
2. **Website Layout**: 
_Designing a layout that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing took us some brainstorming to make the containers to be in the right place._
3. **Integration**: 
_Compiling everyone’s work at the end was more complex than we thought._

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. **From Idea to Reality**: 
_We’ve successfully turned our rough ideas into a real, working website._
2. **Design Satisfaction**: 
_The final design is exactly what we were hoping for._

## What we learned
1. **Teamwork Makes the Dream Work**: 
_We divided our task based on our strengths which leads us to this fantastic product, OlympiaGear._
2. **Communication**: 
_We learned the importance of clear communication - before, during, and after our meetings._
3. **Leveling Up Our Skills**: 
_We got much better at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along the way._

## What's next for OlympiaGear
1. **Screen Reader Functionality**: 
_We want to add features for people with hearing impairments._
2. **Color Correction Filters**: 
_We're thinking about adding filters to help folks with visual impairments, so they could buy shirts they want._
3. **Upgrade Backend System**: 
_We want to add a proper database to handle more advanced shopping features: user accounts, order tracking, and inventory management etc._
4. **Exclusive Merch**: 
_We want to pump up Olympic fans by introducing specialized products celebrating Paris Olympic athletes._

## Conclusion
OlympiaGear isn't just a website - it's our way of spreading Olympic spirit and giving fans an awesome experience. We're pretty proud of what we've done so far, and we can't wait to make it even better!
